# DSA-Data-Analysis-Capstone-Project-Case-Study-1
This Case Study is for Amazon Product Review Analysis; it is a portfolio project where Microsoft Excel was used to build a product review analysis dashboard featuring visuals containing transformed data for effective decisions that will guide product improvement, marketing strategies and customer engagement for the company.
## Project Topic: **Amazon Product Review Analysis**
### Introduction
E-commerce analytics provides solutions to sellers on platforms like Amazon that helps in analysing product and customer review data to generate insights for better marketing strategies and customer engagement.
### Objectives of this project
To build a dashboard using Excel that answers critical questions like:
- Products with the highest number of reviews
- Relationship of rating to the level of discount
- Distribution of product ratings
- Top 5 products in terms of rating and number of reviews combined
### Processes
  #### Data Source
  The dataset was scraped from Amazon product pages including information such as:
  1. Product details (name, category, price, discount and ratings)
  2. Customer engagement (user review, titles, and content)
  - Each row represents a unique product with aggregated reviewer data, stored as comma-separated values.
  #### Data Cleaning
  - Columns that were not needed were removed.
  - Calculated columns were added such as potential revenue per category, rating range, discount percentage bucket.
  #### Visualization
  - Pivot tables were created using the columns on the data table.
  - The dashboard was created from the Pivot Tables.
### Insights
  The Pivot tables and dashboard revealed the following:
  - The number of products having a discount of 50% or more was 751, which was quite high compared to the total number of unique products.
  - High discounts did not necessarily result in high rating.
  - Products having reviews less than 1000 was 328; this reveals that such products need to be improved upon for more customer engagement to help in increasing its sales.
### Recommendations
1. Products with discounts of 50% or more should be reduced.
2. Improved marketimg strategies should be put in place for products, especially those with less reviews.
